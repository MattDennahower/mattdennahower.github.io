## Objective

This project uses a triple Poisson model to analyze the number of points and three point shots made by NBA players in a given game. The model is implemented using the scipy library in Python and is based on the principles of Poisson distribution modeling.
This is a work based on the base assumptions of the triple Poisson model from the following blog post: https://plusevanalytics.wordpress.com/2024/08/10/bet-bash-bonus-the-triple-poisson-model-for-basketball-player-scoring/

#### Future work

1. Incorporate main-line player data with implied probabilities to create a more robust model.
2. Create bot or API to allow for real-time analysis and EV calculation for given combinations of players.
